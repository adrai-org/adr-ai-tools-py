# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Adopt pytest for Comprehensive Testing Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-12

## Context
The project requires a robust testing framework to ensure code quality, catch regressions, and enable confident refactoring. While basic test structure exists, there was no standardized testing configuration or comprehensive coverage strategy. The codebase needs support for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests with proper coverage reporting and mocking capabilities.

## Decision
We will adopt pytest as our primary testing framework with comprehensive configuration including coverage reporting, doctest integration, and mocking capabilities through pytest-mock.

## Rationale
pytest was selected based on the following factors:

- **Modern Python testing**: Industry standard with excellent ecosystem support
- **Function-based approach**: Supports pytest best practices without requiring test classes
- **Rich plugin ecosystem**: Extensive plugins for coverage, mocking, and specialized testing
- **Simple test discovery**: Automatic test discovery with intuitive naming conventions
- **Doctest integration**: Native support for doctest alongside regular tests for simple function validation
- **Excellent mocking**: pytest-mock provides clean, fixture-based mocking without boilerplate
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Detailed test output and coverage reporting capabilities

## Implications
### Positive Implications
- Comprehensive test coverage with automated reporting (80% minimum threshold)
- Support for multiple test types (unit, integration, e2e) with proper markers
- Doctest integration for simple function validation without mocking overhead
- Clean mocking through pytest-mock fixture system
- Consistent testing approach following pytest best practices
- Better developer confidence when making changes
- Easy test execution and debugging in IDEs

### Concerns
- Additional dependencies and configuration overhead
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with pytest ecosystem
- Test execution time may increase with comprehensive coverage
- Need to maintain test quality and coverage standards

## Alternatives
### unittest
- **Characteristics**: Python's built-in testing framework with class-based approach
- **Pros**: No additional dependencies, familiar OOP patterns
- **Cons**: More verbose, requires test classes, limited discovery features, manual mocking setup
- **Rejection reason**: Less flexible and requires more boilerplate than pytest

### nose2
- **Characteristics**: Successor to original nose testing framework
- **Pros**: Good discovery features, plugin support
- **Cons**: Limited active development, smaller community, less comprehensive ecosystem
- **Rejection reason**: pytest has better community support and more active development

### doctest only
- **Characteristics**: Python's built-in documentation testing
- **Pros**: Simple, integrates with documentation
- **Cons**: Limited to simple examples, not suitable for comprehensive testing or mocking
- **Rejection reason**: Not sufficient for complex testing scenarios, but included as complement

## Future Direction
- Integrate pytest with nox for multi-environment testing (pending issue #9)
- Consider adding pytest-xdist for parallel test execution as codebase grows
- Evaluate additional pytest plugins (pytest-benchmark, pytest-timeout) as testing needs evolve
- Monitor test execution performance and optimize as needed
- Establish coverage targets and quality gates for CI/CD integration
- Leverage pytest-mock for clean, maintainable test isolation

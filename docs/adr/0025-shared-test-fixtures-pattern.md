# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Shared Test Fixtures Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-17

## Context
Test suites often require similar setup and teardown logic across multiple test modules. Common patterns include:

- **Isolated filesystem environments**: Tests that need clean file system environments
- **Mock configurations**: Common mocking patterns for external dependencies
- **Test data creation**: Factory functions for creating test objects
- **Environment setup**: Temporary directories, database connections, or service instances

Without a centralized approach, test setup code becomes duplicated across test files, making maintenance difficult and increasing the risk of inconsistent test environments.

## Decision
We will implement shared test fixtures using pytest's `conftest.py` mechanism:

- Common fixtures should be defined in `conftest.py` files at appropriate scope levels
- Fixtures should be reusable across multiple test modules
- Fixtures should provide clean, isolated environments for testing
- Complex setup logic should be encapsulated in fixture functions

## Rationale
This decision was made based on:

- **Technical considerations**: pytest's fixture system provides dependency injection and scope management
- **Code quality**: Centralized fixtures ensure consistent test environments
- **Maintainability**: Changes to test setup logic only need to be made in one place
- **Team productivity**: Developers can focus on test logic rather than setup boilerplate

## Implications
### Positive Implications
- **Reduced Duplication**: Common setup code is written once and reused
- **Consistency**: All tests use the same environment setup
- **Maintainability**: Changes to test infrastructure are centralized
- **Discoverability**: Fixtures are automatically available to tests in the same scope

### Concerns
- **Implicit Dependencies**: Tests depend on fixtures that may not be immediately visible
- **Fixture Complexity**: Complex fixtures can become difficult to understand and debug
- **Scope Management**: Incorrect fixture scopes can lead to unexpected test interactions

## Alternatives
### Inline Test Setup
- **Characteristics**: Each test file contains its own setup and teardown logic
- **Pros**: Explicit setup, no hidden dependencies
- **Cons**: Code duplication, inconsistent environments
- **Rejection reason**: Violates DRY principles and creates maintenance burden

### Test Base Classes
- **Characteristics**: Use inheritance to share common test setup
- **Pros**: Explicit inheritance relationships, reusable setup methods
- **Cons**: Rigid inheritance hierarchy, less flexible than fixtures
- **Rejection reason**: pytest fixtures provide more flexibility and better dependency injection

## Future Direction
- Monitor fixture usage to identify opportunities for further consolidation
- Consider fixture parameterization for testing multiple scenarios
- Evaluate fixture scope optimization for performance improvements
- Review fixture naming conventions to improve discoverability

# ADR-0009: Adopt Typer as CLI Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-14

## Context
The project requires a CLI framework to implement the `adr-ai-tools` command-line interface. Currently, the project uses Python's built-in `argparse` module, which provides basic functionality but becomes verbose and complex as the CLI grows.

The project needs to implement multiple subcommands (starting with `init`) and prioritizes:
- Development efficiency for implementing subcommands
- Long-term maintainability 
- Type safety with mypy integration
- User experience with clear help messages and error handling

## Decision
Adopt Typer as the CLI framework for adr-ai-tools.

## Rationale
After evaluating the main Python CLI frameworks, Typer provides the best balance for our requirements:

### Development Efficiency
- Type hint-based API reduces boilerplate code
- Automatic command generation from function signatures
- Intuitive decorator-based subcommand definition
- Built-in support for common CLI patterns

### Long-term Maintainability
- Active development by the FastAPI author (Sebasti√°n Ramirez)
- Growing adoption in the Python ecosystem
- Built on top of Click (mature, stable foundation)
- Clear, well-documented API

### Type Safety
- Designed around Python type hints from the ground up
- Automatic validation based on type annotations
- Excellent mypy integration and support
- Runtime type checking with helpful error messages

### User Experience
- Automatic help generation from docstrings and type hints
- Beautiful, colorized output
- Intuitive error messages for validation failures
- Consistent behavior across commands

## Implications

### Positive Implications
- Significantly reduced code complexity for CLI implementation
- Automatic input validation and error handling
- Enhanced type safety throughout the CLI layer
- Better user experience with minimal additional effort
- Easier to add new commands and options

### Concerns
- Introduces the project's first runtime dependency
- Additional learning curve for contributors unfamiliar with Typer
- Potential breaking changes in future Typer versions
- Slightly larger installation footprint

## Alternatives

### Continue with argparse
- **Pros**: No additional dependencies, familiar to most Python developers
- **Cons**: Verbose implementation, limited type safety, poor user experience
- **Rejected**: Would significantly slow development and result in inferior UX

### Use Click
- **Pros**: Mature, widely adopted, excellent documentation
- **Cons**: Decorator-heavy API, limited type hint integration
- **Rejected**: Typer provides Click's benefits with better type safety

### Use Fire
- **Pros**: Minimal code required, rapid prototyping
- **Cons**: Limited control over CLI behavior, poor for complex interfaces
- **Rejected**: Insufficient for a professional CLI tool

## Future Direction
- Implement all CLI commands using Typer's type hint-based API
- Leverage Typer's automatic validation for robust input handling
- Utilize rich integration for enhanced terminal output when needed
- Consider Typer's testing utilities for comprehensive CLI testing

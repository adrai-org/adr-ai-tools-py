# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
LoggingService Infrastructure Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-07-18

## Context
The CLI application needed a comprehensive logging strategy that integrates with the established service layer architecture (ADR-0015). The application required:

- Consistent logging configuration across all CLI commands
- Support for different verbosity levels (verbose, quiet, file output)
- Integration with existing service layer patterns
- Auto-configuration for convenience
- Type safety while providing essential functionality

## Decision
Implement LoggingService as an infrastructure service with the following characteristics:

**Service Classification**: Infrastructure service (external concern: logging subsystem)
**Responsibility**: Single responsibility for application-wide logging configuration
**Interface**: Provide both convenience methods (log_info, log_debug, etc.) and direct logger access
**Auto-configuration**: Automatically configure with defaults when methods are called without explicit setup
**Type Safety**: Simple method signatures without `**kwargs` to maintain strict type safety

## Rationale
This decision aligns with established architectural patterns:

**Service Layer Architecture (ADR-0015)**: LoggingService acts as an infrastructure service, handling the external concern of logging subsystem management while providing a clean interface for CLI and other services.

**Service Granularity (ADR-0017)**: LoggingService has a single, well-defined responsibility for logging configuration and provides a focused interface without mixing concerns.

**Dependency Injection (ADR-0016)**: LoggingService can be injected into other services following constructor injection patterns, enabling testability and loose coupling.

**Type Safety**: By using simple method signatures, we eliminate runtime type errors and make the API more predictable and easier to test.

## Implications
### Positive Implications
- Clear separation between CLI logic and logging infrastructure
- Consistent logging behavior across all services
- Auto-configuration reduces boilerplate in simple usage scenarios
- Type-safe API prevents runtime errors
- Testable through dependency injection
- Extensible without modifying existing CLI code

### Concerns
- Additional abstraction layer compared to direct logging module usage
- Auto-configuration may hide configuration issues in complex scenarios
- Services depending on LoggingService must handle its lifecycle appropriately

## Alternatives
### Direct logging module usage in CLI
**Characteristics**: Configure Python logging directly in CLI callback
**Pros**: Simpler, no additional abstraction
**Cons**: Violates service layer architecture, harder to test, configuration scattered across codebase

### Logging configuration in each service
**Characteristics**: Each service configures its own logging
**Pros**: Full control per service
**Cons**: Inconsistent logging behavior, duplicated configuration logic, harder to maintain

### Singleton logging configuration
**Characteristics**: Global singleton for logging configuration
**Pros**: Single point of configuration
**Cons**: Violates dependency injection patterns, harder to test, global state issues

## Future Direction
- Consider structured logging support if application complexity grows
- Evaluate logging middleware patterns for cross-cutting concerns
- Potential integration with telemetry systems
- Consider configuration file support for logging preferences

# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Use UV as Python Dependency Management Tool

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-05-11

## Context
The adr-ai-tools-py project requires a robust dependency management solution for Python that ensures:
- Reproducible builds across different environments
- Fast dependency resolution and installation
- Good compatibility with modern Python packaging standards
- Support for development environments and production deployments
- Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines

We needed to choose between several Python package managers (pip, pipenv, poetry, pdm, and uv) to standardize our development workflow and ensure consistent dependency management.

## Decision
We have decided to adopt UV as our primary Python dependency management tool for the adr-ai-tools-py project.

## Rationale
UV was selected for the following reasons:

- **Performance**: UV offers significantly faster dependency resolution and package installation compared to traditional tools like pip and pipenv.
- **Lock File Support**: UV generates a comprehensive lock file (uv.lock) that captures exact versions of all dependencies, ensuring build reproducibility.
- **Modern Standards**: UV fully supports modern Python packaging standards including PEP 517/518.
- **Compatibility**: UV maintains high compatibility with the broader Python ecosystem and works well with setuptools-based projects.
- **Active Development**: UV has an active development community with regular updates and improvements.
- **Simplified Workflow**: UV provides a unified interface for common package management tasks, reducing the complexity of our development workflow.
- **Integration**: UV integrates well with our existing development tools and CI/CD pipelines.

## Implications
### Positive Implications
- Faster dependency resolution and installation will improve developer productivity
- Explicit lock files will ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production
- Better dependency resolution will reduce "works on my machine" problems
- Simplified commands for common tasks will improve developer experience
- Clear separation of development and production dependencies

### Concerns
- Team members will need to learn UV commands and workflows
- UV is relatively newer compared to some alternatives, which may introduce some risks
- Integration with some specialized tools might require additional configuration

## Alternatives
### pip + requirements.txt
- **Pros**: Standard tool, widespread knowledge, simple
- **Cons**: Lacks lock file capabilities, slower resolution, harder to separate dev/prod dependencies
- **Rejection Reason**: Insufficient reproducibility guarantees and dependency management features

### pipenv
- **Pros**: Lockfile support, virtual environment management
- **Cons**: Slower performance, development has slowed, complex dependency resolution
- **Rejection Reason**: Performance issues and concerns about future maintenance

### Poetry
- **Pros**: Good dependency resolution, project management, publishing capabilities
- **Cons**: Can be opinionated about project structure, occasional compatibility issues
- **Rejection Reason**: Project structure requirements didn't align with our existing codebase

### PDM
- **Pros**: Fast performance, PEP 582 support, modern features
- **Cons**: Smaller community, less integration with some tools
- **Rejection Reason**: Smaller ecosystem and community support compared to UV

## Future Direction
- Create standardized UV workflows for development, testing, and deployment
- Document UV commands and best practices for team reference
- Monitor UV updates for new features and improvements
- Evaluate integration with additional tools in our pipeline as needed
- Periodically reassess this decision if UV development slows or issues arise

# ADR-0018: Adopt Pydantic Settings for Configuration Management

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-15

## Context
The ADR AI Tools application needs a configuration management system to handle user preferences, ADR templates customization, and application settings. The system must support multiple configuration sources (files, environment variables, CLI args) with clear precedence, integrate with existing Pydantic models, and provide type safety.

## Decision
Adopt `pydantic-settings` as the configuration management library for the ADR AI Tools application with `ADRAI_` environment variable prefix.

## Rationale
- **Pydantic Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Pydantic models (ADR-0012)
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and validation support with mypy compatibility
- **Multiple Sources**: Built-in support for environment variables, TOML files, and direct values
- **Precedence Handling**: Clear, configurable precedence order for configuration sources
- **Validation**: Automatic validation and error reporting for configuration values

## Implications

### Positive Implications
- Consistent validation and type system across all models
- Multiple configuration sources with clear precedence
- Excellent IDE support and error messages

### Concerns
- Additional external dependency beyond core Pydantic
- TOML support requires additional parsing dependency

## Alternatives
- **Standard configparser**: No external dependencies but poor type safety
- **JSON files**: Standard format but no comments or validation
- **Custom implementation**: Full control but high implementation cost
- **Dynaconf**: Very powerful but over-engineered for CLI tool

## Future Direction
- Implement ConfigurationService as Infrastructure Service following ADR-0015
- Add CLI commands: `config get`, `config set`, `config list`
- Support project-local and global configuration files

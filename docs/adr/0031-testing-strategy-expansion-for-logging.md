# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Testing Strategy Expansion for Logging

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-07-18

## Context
The implementation of LoggingService required expanding the testing strategy to cover infrastructure services that interact with Python's logging module. Key challenges included:

- E2E testing of CLI logging output with pexpect
- Unit testing of services that use `logging.basicConfig`
- Integration testing of multi-layered logging behavior
- Maintaining test isolation when dealing with global logging state

## Decision
Expand testing strategy with three distinct test layers:

**E2E Tests**: Use pexpect to test CLI logging output behavior in real execution environment
**Unit Tests**: Test LoggingService methods directly, accepting that `basicConfig` usage limits log capture testing
**Integration Tests**: Test complex scenarios involving multiple loggers, configuration changes, and file output

## Rationale
**E2E Testing**: Tests actual CLI behavior including logging output, ensuring the complete user experience works as expected.

**Limited Log Capture**: LoggingService uses `basicConfig` which interferes with pytest's caplog fixture. Rather than work around this, we test the service interface directly and verify file output.

**Integration Test Layer**: Complex logging scenarios (multiple loggers, reconfiguration, file+console output) require integration tests that go beyond unit test scope.

**Test Isolation**: Each test creates fresh LoggingService instances to avoid global logging state interference between tests.

## Implications
### Positive Implications
- Comprehensive test coverage across all interaction levels
- Reliable E2E testing of actual CLI logging behavior
- Clear separation of test concerns (unit, integration, E2E)
- Realistic testing of logging behavior in various scenarios

### Concerns
- Cannot directly test log message capture in unit tests
- Integration tests may be more fragile than pure unit tests
- Global logging state requires careful test isolation

## Alternatives
### Mock-based logging testing
**Characteristics**: Mock logging module calls instead of testing actual output
**Pros**: Complete control over test environment, no global state issues
**Cons**: Tests don't verify actual logging behavior, may miss integration issues

### Custom logging handler for testing
**Characteristics**: Implement test-specific logging handler for capture
**Pros**: Allows direct log message testing
**Cons**: Adds complexity, may not reflect real logging behavior

### Separate test configuration
**Characteristics**: Different logging configuration for tests
**Pros**: Avoids `basicConfig` conflicts
**Cons**: Tests don't verify production logging behavior

## Future Direction
- Consider structured logging support which may enable better testing
- Evaluate test utilities for logging service testing
- Monitor for pytest caplog improvements that work with basicConfig
- Consider test-specific logging configuration patterns

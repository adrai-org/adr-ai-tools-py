# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Adopt MyPy for Static Type Checking

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-12

## Context
The project currently lacks static type checking, which can lead to runtime errors and makes code harder to understand and maintain. As a Python toolkit for ADR management, we need to ensure code reliability and improve developer experience through better tooling. The codebase has basic type hints in place but no automated type checking to verify their correctness.

## Decision
We will adopt MyPy as our static type checking tool with strict configuration settings enabled.

## Rationale
MyPy was selected based on the following factors:

- **Mature ecosystem**: MyPy is the most established type checker in the Python ecosystem with extensive community support
- **Comprehensive features**: Supports advanced type checking features including generics, protocols, and type guards
- **IDE integration**: Excellent integration with VSCode and other popular IDEs
- **Configuration flexibility**: Highly configurable to match project requirements
- **Team familiarity**: Well-documented and widely adopted in the Python community

## Implications
### Positive Implications
- Early detection of type-related bugs before runtime
- Improved code documentation through enforced type hints
- Better IDE support with enhanced autocomplete and error detection
- Reduced debugging time during development
- Safer refactoring with type-aware analysis
- Enhanced code maintainability and readability

### Concerns
- Additional development overhead for writing and maintaining type hints
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with advanced typing concepts
- Potential false positives requiring type: ignore comments
- Build time increase due to additional checking step

## Alternatives
### Pyright/Pylance
- **Characteristics**: Microsoft's type checker with excellent VSCode integration
- **Pros**: Fast performance, good error messages, tight VSCode integration
- **Cons**: Less mature ecosystem, fewer configuration options, smaller community
- **Rejection reason**: Less flexible configuration and smaller community support

### Pyre
- **Characteristics**: Facebook's type checker focused on performance
- **Pros**: Good performance for large codebases, incremental checking
- **Cons**: Limited community adoption, less flexible configuration
- **Rejection reason**: Limited adoption and less comprehensive documentation

### PyCharm's built-in type checker
- **Characteristics**: IDE-specific type checking solution
- **Pros**: Seamless integration with PyCharm IDE
- **Cons**: IDE-specific, not available for other development environments
- **Rejection reason**: Doesn't work across different development environments

## Future Direction
- Monitor MyPy performance as codebase grows and consider incremental checking options
- Evaluate adoption of advanced typing features like protocols and type guards as team expertise grows
- Consider integrating MyPy with CI/CD pipeline for automated type checking
- Potential migration to Pyright if performance becomes a significant issue in the future

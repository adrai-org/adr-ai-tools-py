# ADR-0015: Service Layer Architecture for CLI Commands

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-14

## Context
The CLI application needs a clear architectural pattern for implementing commands while maintaining separation of concerns, testability, and adherence to SOLID principles. The initial `init` command implementation establishes patterns that will be followed by future commands.

Key considerations include:
- Business logic placement and organization
- Dependency management between layers
- Testing strategy and isolation
- Code reusability across commands
- Maintenance and evolution of the codebase

## Decision
Adopt a three-layer service-oriented architecture for CLI command implementation:

1. **CLI Layer** (Presentation): Handle user input/output, argument parsing, and command routing
2. **Service Layer** (Business Logic): Implement core business operations and coordinate between services
3. **Infrastructure Layer** (External Dependencies): Handle file system operations, user interactions, and external resources

## Rationale

### Separation of Concerns
- **CLI Layer**: Focused solely on user interface concerns (input parsing, output formatting)
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic independent of delivery mechanism
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles external dependencies and side effects

### SOLID Principles Alignment
- **Single Responsibility**: Each layer has a distinct, well-defined purpose
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level business logic depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Open/Closed**: New functionality can be added without modifying existing layers

### Testability Benefits
- **Unit Testing**: Service layer can be tested in isolation using mocks
- **Integration Testing**: Infrastructure layer can be tested against real dependencies
- **E2E Testing**: CLI layer tested through actual command execution

### Maintainability
- **Clear Boundaries**: Easy to understand where different types of logic belong
- **Loose Coupling**: Changes in one layer minimally impact others
- **Code Reuse**: Service layer logic can be reused across different CLI commands

## Implementation Pattern

### CLI Layer Example
```python
@app.command()
def init() -> None:
    # Dependency injection - create service instances
    file_system_service = FileSystemService()
    user_interaction_service = UserInteractionService()
    initializer = AdrInitializer(file_system_service, user_interaction_service)
    
    # Execute business logic
    result = initializer.initialize()
    
    # Handle output based on result
    if result.success:
        # Display success messages
    else:
        # Handle errors and exit codes
```

### Service Layer Example
```python
class AdrInitializer:
    def __init__(self, file_system_service: FileSystemService, user_interaction_service: UserInteractionService):
        self.file_system_service = file_system_service
        self.user_interaction_service = user_interaction_service
    
    def initialize(self) -> InitializationResult:
        # Business logic implementation
```

### Infrastructure Layer Example
```python
class FileSystemService:
    def create_directory(self, path: Path) -> None:
        # Direct file system interaction
        
class UserInteractionService:
    def ask_confirmation(self, message: str) -> bool:
        # Direct user interaction
```

## Implications

### Positive Implications
- **Clear Architecture**: Well-defined layers with distinct responsibilities
- **Enhanced Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes are localized to appropriate layers
- **Code Reusability**: Service layer logic can be shared across commands
- **SOLID Compliance**: Architecture naturally follows SOLID principles

### Concerns
- **Additional Complexity**: More files and classes than a monolithic approach
- **Learning Curve**: Contributors need to understand layered architecture
- **Potential Over-engineering**: May be excessive for simple commands

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Documentation**: Clear guidelines on layer responsibilities and patterns
- **Examples**: Provide template implementations for new commands
- **Gradual Adoption**: Start with proven patterns and evolve as needed

## Alternatives

### Monolithic CLI Functions
- **Pros**: Simple, direct implementation with minimal structure
- **Cons**: Poor testability, violates SOLID principles, difficult to maintain
- **Rejected**: Doesn't scale well and makes testing difficult

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Pros**: Rich domain modeling, strong business logic organization
- **Cons**: Over-engineered for CLI tools, excessive complexity
- **Rejected**: Too complex for the problem domain

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Pros**: Well-known pattern, clear separation of concerns
- **Cons**: UI-centric pattern, doesn't fit CLI architecture well
- **Rejected**: Better suited for GUI applications

## Future Direction
- **Pattern Documentation**: Create templates and guidelines for new command implementation
- **Service Evolution**: Allow services to evolve while maintaining interface contracts
- **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Consider aspect-oriented programming for logging, validation, etc.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor service layer performance as application grows

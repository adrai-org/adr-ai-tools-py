# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Python Version Support Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-12

## Context
The project needs to establish clear guidelines for which Python versions to support. This decision affects dependency management, testing matrix, development workflows, and user compatibility. Python versions have predictable lifecycle patterns with new releases annually and end-of-life dates that should guide our support strategy.

## Decision
We will support Python versions 3.9 through 3.13 based on official Python support status:

### Support Matrix
- **Python 3.9**: Supported (EOL October 2025)
- **Python 3.10**: Supported (EOL October 2026)
- **Python 3.11**: Supported (EOL October 2027) - Primary development version
- **Python 3.12**: Supported (EOL October 2028)
- **Python 3.13**: Supported (EOL October 2029)

### Support Criteria
- **Minimum support**: Only officially supported Python versions
- **Early adoption**: Add new Python versions within 6 months of release
- **Deprecation timeline**: Remove versions 6 months after official EOL
- **Primary version**: Use Python 3.11 for development and primary testing

## Rationale

### Official Support Alignment
- **Security maintenance**: Unsupported Python versions receive no security updates
- **Ecosystem compatibility**: Most major packages follow similar support timelines
- **Modern Python features**: Focus on versions with current language capabilities

### Balanced Version Range
- **User accessibility**: Support commonly used stable versions
- **Future compatibility**: Include latest versions for early adopters
- **Manageable testing**: Reasonable matrix size for CI/CD efficiency

### Conservative Deprecation
- **User migration time**: Clear timeline allows users to plan upgrades
- **Predictable support**: Consistent policy enables advance planning

## Implications
### Positive Implications
- Clear upgrade path for users with predictable timelines
- Reduced security risk from unsupported Python versions
- Simplified testing matrix focusing on supported versions
- Access to modern Python features across supported range
- Alignment with Python community best practices

### Concerns
- Testing overhead for multiple Python versions
- Need to monitor Python release schedule and plan version updates
- Breaking changes when dropping Python version support

## Alternatives
### Extended Legacy Support
- **Characteristics**: Support Python 3.8 and earlier versions
- **Pros**: Maximum backward compatibility
- **Cons**: Security risks, maintenance burden, ecosystem limitations
- **Rejection reason**: Security and maintenance costs outweigh benefits

### Minimal Version Support
- **Characteristics**: Support only 2-3 most recent Python versions
- **Pros**: Reduced testing overhead
- **Cons**: Excludes users on stable but older versions
- **Rejection reason**: Too restrictive for tool adoption

## Future Direction
- **Annual review**: Reassess version support as new Python versions are released
- **Automated monitoring**: Track Python EOL dates and ecosystem support
- **Clear communication**: Document version support changes in advance
